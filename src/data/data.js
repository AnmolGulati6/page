        title: "From Rows to Reasoning: A Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Framework for Spreadsheet Understanding",
        authors: "Anmol Gulati, Sahil Sen, Waqar Sarguroh, Kevin Paul",
        abstract: "We introduce FRTR, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework that decomposes Excel workbooks into granular row, column, and block embeddings, employs hybrid lexical-dense retrieval with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), and integrates multimodal embeddings to reason over both numerical and visual information. Achieving 74% accuracy on FRTR-Bench with Claude Sonnet 4.5, a substantial improvement over prior state-of-the-art approaches that reached only 24%.",
